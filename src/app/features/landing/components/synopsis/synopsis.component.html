          <p>
            Lost Worlds is a tabletop roleplaying game set across different eras of Earth's 
            hidden magical history. This is not a world where magic belongs only to wizards 
            in towers or creatures from distant realms. Magic is woven into the fabric of 
            existence itself.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Cosmic Realms and the Earthly Realms have never held a single, stable 
            relationship. Throughout history, the two have drifted together and pulled 
            apart like tides governed by no single moon. There have been ages of unity 
            when cosmic beings walked openly among mortals. There have been ages of 
            separation when humanity forgot what it had lost.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Your party will step into one of these turbulent eras and uncover truths 
            that history tried to bury. Will you fight to reunite the severed realms 
            or ensure they remain apart? Will your names echo through history like the 
            beings who gave form to abstract ideas?

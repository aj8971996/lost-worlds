        "session_notes_preface": "We are introduced to our adventurers: Holden Green and Rosemary Alderwood. It's another night at the Golden Nugget casino, and the audience is strewn about the one-armed bandits and blackjack tables. Rosemary starts her first shift, running about and following a variety of orders from the staff. Holden prepares for just another night to provide a spectacular show to their guests! As quips draw the crowd near, an unsuspecting member of the crowd is brought up to the stage for what could be a deadly night.",
        "session_notes_combat": "The show is moving along spectacularly, that is, until a mischievous imp appears out of nowhere. This doesn't appear to be a problem for Holden, though; something draws his aim directly towards where the imp was going to appear. Even before Holden himself knew what was going on...As the Hellfire Imp begins to advance, Holden keeps it at bay while trying to discern if this is some part of the show. The guests and management seem to do the same. Rosemary keeps an eye on the stage, unsure of herself - and after no one can discern who did this, no more punches are held. That Hellfire Imp is turned into a pincushion by The Magnificent Green Blade, while the new employee, Rosemary, gets her first taste of city life!",
        "session_notes_end": "With the show having come to a close, Brandon, Tucker, and Ebbers tell the two adventurers that seeing them go against the Damned Minion was impressive. They have been looking for a pair of employees who could get a special job done. Tuck tells them that his connections have heard there are strange goings-on with the mass migration of people out to the city and all the new construction along the Las Vegas strip. They want the two of them to meet them in owner's office bright and early. ",
